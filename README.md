Aim of this project (real world example) is an implementation of data processing algorithm
using concepts of advanced Scala Types:
- Phantom Types: steps of algorithms are described in typesafe-way 
- Recursive Types (F-bounded polymorphism): data description using 
- Self-types: even stronger data description
 

This is still in progress project.
Stay tuned!
