Aim of this project is an implementation of data processing algorithm
using concepts of advanced Scala Types to describe (real world example):
- steps of alghoritms in typesafe way using Phantom Types
- data description using Recursive Types (F-bounded polymorphism)

This is still in progress project.
Stay tuned!
